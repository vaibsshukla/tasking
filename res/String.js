        event_details: 'The Indonesian Province of the Riau Islands (PRI) has a population of almost 2 million, and a land area of 8,200 sq kilometres dispersed across a vast maritime expanse. Situated close to Singapore, the islands of Batam, Bintan, and Karimun have established reputations for activities such as electronics assembly, and ship building. Drawing on its trading heritage and openness to foreign direct investment, in 2004 the Riau Islands seceded from Riau to establish a separate province. Since then, the fledgling province has had to contend with formidable challenges, including creating and staffing an entirely new government, weathering slumps in established economic sectors, and navigating between local needs and national policy frameworks.',
